### 💡 Technical Philosophy

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
We believe no single programming language excels at everything, but through the deep integration of three programming languages, EasyAIoT leverages the strengths of each to build a powerful technical ecosystem.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
Java excels at building stable and reliable platform architectures but is not suitable for network programming and AI development; Python excels at network programming and AI algorithm development but has bottlenecks in high-performance task execution; C++ excels at high-performance task execution but is less suitable than the other two for platform development and AI programming. EasyAIoT adopts a tri-lingual mixed programming architecture, fully leveraging the strengths of each language to build an AIoT platform that's challenging to implement but extremely easy to use.

### 🤖 Zero-Shot Labeling Technology

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
Innovatively leveraging large models to construct a zero-shot labeling technical system (ideally completely eliminating manual labeling, achieving full automation of the labeling process), this technology generates initial data through large models and completes automatic labeling via prompt engineering. It then ensures data quality through optional human-machine collaborative verification, thereby training an initial small model. This small model, through continuous iteration and self-optimization, achieves co-evolution of labeling efficiency and model accuracy, ultimately driving continuous improvement in system performance.

### 🏗️ Project Architecture Features

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
EasyAIoT is not actually one project; it is seven distinct projects.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
What's the benefit? Suppose you are on a resource-constrained device (like an RK3588). You can extract and independently deploy just one of those projects. Therefore, while this project appears to be a cloud platform, it simultaneously functions as an edge platform.

## ☁️ EasyAIoT = AI + IoT = Cloud-Edge Integrated Solution

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin: 15px 0;">
Supports thousands of vertical scenarios with customizable AI models and algorithm development.

<h3 style="color: #2c3e50; margin-top: 0;">Deep Integration Empowers Intelligent Vision for Everything</h3>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 10px 0;">
EasyAIoT constructs an efficient access and management network for IoT devices (especially massive cameras). We deeply integrate real-time streaming technology with cutting-edge AI to create a unified service core. This solution not only enables interoperability across heterogeneous devices but also deeply integrates HD video streams with powerful AI analytics engines, giving surveillance systems "intelligent eyes" – accurately enabling facial recognition, abnormal behavior analysis, risk personnel monitoring, and perimeter intrusion detection.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 10px 0;">
The platform supports two types of algorithm tasks: real-time algorithm tasks for real-time video analysis of RTSP/RTMP streams, providing millisecond-level response capabilities; snapshot algorithm tasks for intelligent analysis of captured images, supporting event backtracking and image retrieval. Through algorithm task management, flexible frame extraction and sorting strategies are achieved, with each task able to bind independent frame extractors and sorters. Combined with model service cluster inference capabilities, millisecond-level response and high availability are ensured. Additionally, two defense strategies are provided: full defense mode and half defense mode, allowing flexible configuration of monitoring rules for different time periods, achieving precise time-based intelligent monitoring and alerting.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 10px 0;">
In terms of IoT device management, EasyAIoT provides comprehensive device lifecycle management capabilities, supporting multiple IoT protocols (MQTT, TCP, HTTP) to achieve rapid device access, secure authentication, real-time monitoring, and intelligent control. Through the rule engine, intelligent data flow and processing of device data are realized, combined with AI capabilities for in-depth analysis of device data, achieving full-process automation from device access, data collection, intelligent analysis to decision execution, truly realizing interconnected everything and intelligent control of everything.
