## 📖 Project Overview

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin: 15px 0;">
<strong>yFeiEye</strong> is a <strong>cloud-edge-device integrated intelligent algorithm application platform</strong> dedicated to deeply fusing artificial intelligence with the Internet of Things—enabling cameras, sensors, and edge compute to work together on site. From device onboarding and data collection to real-time visual analysis, intelligent assessment, and alert orchestration, the entire chain runs on a single software stack.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin: 15px 0;">
Many smart IoT projects hit the same wall at deployment: video systems, device platforms, and algorithm services live in silos—integration is costly, operations are fragmented, and scaling is painful. <strong>yFeiEye resolves this with one platform</strong>—the same software deploys on a 4 GB edge box for single-point intelligence, on AI all-in-one cameras for floor-level coverage, or inside an enterprise full-stack appliance that packs IoT management, massive video access, and AI analysis into one box—no multiple versions to maintain, no repeated integration across heterogeneous systems.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin: 15px 0;">
The platform comprises seven core modules—<strong>WEB, APP, DEVICE, NODE, VIDEO, AI, and TASK</strong>—with Java as the stable control foundation, Python for AI and networking, and C++ for high-performance compute tasks, each language playing to its strengths. On the capability side: GB28181 / ONVIF multi-protocol camera access, real-time and snapshot algorithm tasks, YOLO object detection and SAM zero-shot auto-annotation, face/plate recognition, orchestrable business post-processing, federated compute cluster scheduling, and MQTT / TCP / HTTP IoT device lifecycle management. On the experience side: the Web console and mobile App / mini-program are capability-aligned, so command centers and field inspections share the same business logic—handle incidents anytime, anywhere.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #444; margin: 16px 0 8px 0;">
<strong>In one sentence:</strong> yFeiEye = AI + IoT—interconnect everything while enabling intelligent vision and intelligent control for everything.
</p>

</p>

### 🎯 Three Tiers, One Platform

<p style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.8; color: #333; margin: 15px 0;">
Many intelligent IoT projects stall at deployment: <strong>full features won't fit on small machines; to make them fit, you cut capabilities, split versions, and maintain multiple deployment packages.</strong> yFeiEye resolves this with one platform—<strong>edge boxes for point intelligence, AI all-in-one cameras for on-wall analysis, AIoT full-stack all-in-ones for the complete stack in one box</strong>. Pick the tier that matches your field hardware; the same software runs from single-site pilots through floor coverage to full-stack delivery—no split versions.

#### 🧠 AI Capabilities

<ul style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #444; margin: 10px 0;">
  <li><strong>Custom Platform Name &amp; Logo Across All Touchpoints</strong>: After deploying yFeiEye on site, users should see <em>their</em> platform—not a generic product name. The monitoring dashboard includes a visual "Platform Branding" panel where administrators can rebrand in the UI: update the admin console name and logo (synced to the sidebar and browser tab); set an independent command-center title on the big screen; and customize the login page name, logo, form title, plus light/dark background images—all three touchpoints stay visually consistent, take effect immediately, and can be saved or reset with one click.
    <ul style="margin: 5px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>For system integrators and solution providers</strong>: Eliminates front-end reskinning, custom development, and release cycles; switch branding quickly between PoC demos and production delivery, reuse one codebase across multiple customers, shorten payment cycles, and improve solution reuse</li>
      <li><strong>For government, campus, hospital, and other end users</strong>: Login page, command dashboard, and daily admin console all display their organization's name and identity—stronger ownership and credibility for leadership visits and internal rollout, meeting branding requirements for public-sector and large-enterprise IT projects</li>
      <li><strong>For private-deployment and operations teams</strong>: Configure on site the same day for acceptance—no waiting on development schedules; one-click restore after multi-customer demos or pilot phases, lowering switching and redeployment costs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>YOLO26 Next-Generation Object Detection</strong>: Built-in next-generation object detection, ready out of the box for real-time feed analysis and snapshot recognition. On the same hardware, connect more camera streams with faster response and fewer false alarms. Supports the full loop from data collection, annotation, and training to deployment and inference—helping users iteratively build custom detection models at lower cost and quickly cover common security and industrial scenarios such as hard hat compliance, unauthorized entry, and fire hazards, making "see accurately, compute fast, scale easily" the default capability</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Protocol Camera Access Support</strong>: Comprehensive support for GB28181 and ONVIF, two mainstream video surveillance protocols, enabling standardized device access and management. GB28181, as China's national standard, perfectly adapts to mainstream domestic surveillance equipment; ONVIF, as an international universal standard, is widely compatible with global mainstream camera brands. Through dual-protocol support, the platform seamlessly integrates with existing surveillance systems, achieving plug-and-play device access, automatic discovery, and unified management, significantly reducing device access barriers, enhancing system compatibility and scalability, and providing a solid technical foundation for large-scale camera deployment. In addition, NVR batch scan, registration, and unified management across same-segment and cross-segment networks are supported, covering mainstream brands including Hikvision, Dahua, Huawei, Ezviz, and Xiaomi, with native-protocol subnet discovery, one-click registration, and batch channel import, further reducing the cost of large-scale surveillance device onboarding and operations</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Intercom & PTZ Remote Control</strong>: Breaks through traditional surveillance's "watch-only, can't act" limitation. Operators can conduct voice broadcasting and PTZ control on the same real-time preview screen—no system switching, no on-site presence required. Remotely communicate, guide evacuations, or stop violations, compressing response from "dispatch personnel" to "speak and reach instantly." PTZ control lets cameras pan, tilt, and zoom on demand—quickly aim at incident areas and magnify details during emergencies, forming an integrated on-site response loop of "see clearly, aim precisely, speak and reach." Fully compatible with GB28181 and ONVIF devices, leveraging existing surveillance assets without additional intercom hardware or third-party software, instantly upgrading deployed cameras with remote communication and flexible dispatch capabilities, significantly reducing system silos and monitoring costs</li>
  <li><strong>Orchestrable Algorithm Post-Processing</strong>: Breaks through the "detect but can't judge" bottleneck by adding an independent business judgment layer on top of object detection, transforming visual perception results into operable, accountable, and statistically trackable business events. Supports flexible per-task definition of scenario rules such as people counting, line-crossing, dwell timeout, area loitering, and multi-condition composite alerts—quickly adapting to differentiated needs in construction site safety supervision, campus security, and traffic control without repeatedly tuning models, forging general vision capabilities into field-ready management tools. Post-processing and real-time analysis run independently and in parallel—monitoring feeds continue smooth judgment while business logic scales elastically on demand; judgment results are automatically archived and drive precise alerts, significantly reducing false positives/negatives and manual review costs. Business users focus on rule expression while the platform handles distribution, execution, and scale—truly moving from "being able to see" to "judge clearly, control effectively, and put it to use"</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Central-Node × Multi-Worker-Node Federated Cluster</strong>: Designed for cross-region, multi-datacenter, and cloud-edge collaborative deployments, the platform adopts an "N central nodes + N worker nodes" federated architecture—central nodes serve as the unified control plane while worker nodes act as the compute and media execution plane, building a horizontally scalable distributed scheduling system. Each central node manages its own worker cluster, supporting runtime distribution and one-click remote deployment of monitoring agents, distributed storage, streaming engines, FFmpeg transcoding, video analytics runtimes, and model inference/training workloads. Multiple central nodes can interconnect and synchronize; the cluster swimlane view intuitively presents "central—worker" topology and resource levels, with lane-level batch maintenance and component distribution. Algorithm tasks, auto-labeling pipelines, and stream relay workloads are intelligently scheduled by node role and GPU capability with elastic queue dispatch—enabling massive stream ingestion, high-concurrency inference, and distributed training to run together in one cluster, truly delivering "onboard easily, schedule clearly, scale openly, govern completely"</li>
  <li><strong>SAM Zero-Start Auto-Labeling Orchestration Pipeline</strong>: Built for cold-start scenarios with no annotated samples and no usable detection model, the platform integrates SAM open-vocabulary segmentation with an intelligent orchestration engine to deliver a one-click, unattended labeling pipeline. Per strategy, the system automatically chains camera frame extraction, SAM text-prompt bootstrap labeling, YOLO fine-tuning once thresholds are met, production-phase YOLO high-speed inference with intelligent SAM fallback for missed detections, periodic iterative training, and automatic dataset packaging and export—closing the full "capture-annotate-train-export" loop. The orchestration hub continuously tracks pipeline phase and labeling progress, autonomously deciding among SAM, YOLO, and hybrid supplement modes and when to trigger training; supports pause/resume and elastic scheduling on local or cluster compute queues. With visual strategy configuration and run logs, users can grow a custom detection capability from zero samples and zero models, making "define categories in words, watch the model take shape" the default path for dataset building</li>
  <li><strong>Ten-Thousand-Node Elastic Compute Cluster & Horizontal Scaling Pool</strong>: Built for hyperscale AI and video workloads, the platform provides a cloud-edge-end distributed compute foundation that unifies algorithm tasks, stream relay, algorithm services, model training, and inference under one horizontal load-balancing and elastic scaling fabric. New servers join the fleet with one-click onboarding and immediately become schedulable compute units—the control plane automatically dispatches work and balances load based on resource levels and business pressure, enabling linear scaling from hundreds to tens of thousands of camera streams and from a single machine to ten-thousand-node clusters without redeployment or manual tuning. Massive stream ingestion, high-concurrency inference, and distributed training run together in a shared compute pool—truly delivering "scale on demand, run reliably, govern with confidence"</li>
  <li><strong>Tianditu Spatial Visualization & Map-Based Analysis</strong>: Integrated with China's national Tianditu map service, the platform brings cameras, alerts, and person/vehicle recognition onto a single map—upgrading surveillance from "watching feeds" to "seeing the big picture." Both the streaming media and alert modules offer a "Map Distribution" view with a device directory tree for regional focus, giving instant visibility into checkpoint layout and online status. Map click-to-pin, location search, and batch coordinate import help GB channels, NVR channels, and direct-connect cameras get mapped quickly so every feed has clear spatial context. Alerts are automatically placed on the map via linked camera coordinates; filter by time, event type, task, and business tags, then open snapshots and recordings in one click—helping operators move fast from "where did it happen" to action. Combined with face and plate libraries, hits across multiple sites can be woven into spatial trails—<strong>trace by person</strong> to reconstruct movement and presence within a monitored area; <strong>trace by vehicle</strong> to link passing records and pinpoint routes and stop zones for find-person/find-vehicle, patrol deployment, and post-incident review. Mobile devices also support track playback to replay patrol and travel paths on a timeline. Switch freely between vector and satellite basemaps with auto-fit view, so managers use the map as the anchor to spot anomalies, lock onto targets, and coordinate response faster</li>
  <li><strong>Qwen / DeepSeek Multi-GPU Deployment</strong>: Supports deploying Qwen, DeepSeek, and other large language models across multiple GPUs in parallel. GPU resources can be scheduled flexibly at the cluster and Worker level, enabling elastic scaling and load balancing of model instances to deliver stable inference under high concurrency and long-context workloads</li>
  <li><strong>Vision Large Model Intelligent Understanding</strong>: Integrated with QwenVL3 vision large model, supports deep visual reasoning and semantic understanding of real-time video frames, enabling intelligent analysis and scene comprehension of frame content, providing richer visual cognitive capabilities, achieving a leap from pixel-level perception to semantic-level understanding</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Camera Feed AI Analysis</strong>: For RTSP/RTMP real-time video streams, builds a full-chain analysis pipeline of "stream pull & decode → intelligent frame extraction → model inference → structured output → alert linkage", converting frame changes into searchable, analyzable structured detection events with millisecond response. Viewing chain and algorithm chain are architecturally decoupled, with tiered bitrates and multi-GPU collaborative scheduling balanced together, balancing preview clarity and high-concurrency throughput. Analysis results seamlessly connect with detection regions, defense time periods, face/plate recognition, and orchestrable post-processing rules, upgrading the traditional "human staring at screens, reviewing after the fact" duty model to "machines monitor 24/7, anomalies pushed in seconds, evidence auto-archived", turning real-time video from passive viewing into infrastructure for active perception and intelligent judgment</li>
  <li><strong>Intelligent Camera Patrol</strong>: Designed for monitoring scenarios with many camera streams but limited staffing, the platform provides split-screen patrol and device-directory batch patrol capabilities, performing rotational AI analysis across large-scale camera fleets under limited concurrent connections. Supports three scheduling modes—rotation, connection pool, and hybrid—automatically capturing frames at set intervals, running detection models, and linking alerts with face/plate recognition. In hybrid mode, focus streams stay permanently monitored while background streams rotate via pooled connections, balancing priority surveillance and full-area coverage. Patrol progress is pushed in real time, captured frames are automatically archived, and patrol sessions for hundreds of cameras can be launched in one click from split-screen views or device directories—upgrading traditional manual screen-by-screen monitoring to intelligent automated patrol with "fewer connections, broader coverage, faster discovery"</li>
  <li><strong>Cloud-Edge-Device Integrated Algorithm Alert Monitoring Dashboard</strong>: Provides a unified cloud-edge-device integrated algorithm alert monitoring dashboard that displays key information in real-time, including device status, algorithm task operations, alarm event statistics, and video stream analysis results. Supports multi-dimensional data visualization, achieving unified monitoring and management of cloud, edge, and device layers, providing decision-makers with a global perspective intelligent monitoring command center</li>
  <li><strong>Face Recognition and Face Library Management</strong>: Supports flexibly enabling face recognition in camera tasks. Built on Milvus for face library and facial feature vector management, it provides create/query/update/delete capabilities for face samples and feature vectors, as well as high-performance vector retrieval. It supports efficient face comparison and identity retrieval on captured frames, while fully recording match results, snapshots, camera location information, and device context for personnel trajectory tracing, security forensics, and multidimensional statistical analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>License Plate Recognition and Plate Library Management</strong>: Enable license plate recognition in monitoring tasks with one click. Automatically reads plate information from passing vehicles and compares against your own plate libraries in real time. Flexibly maintain whitelists, blacklists, and business tags; trigger instant alerts when vehicles match rules—supporting access control at entrances and exits, targeted vehicle watchlists, and visitor vs. registered vehicle management. Automatically registers newly seen plates and keeps complete capture and match records for post-incident lookups, trace verification, and evidence retention. Recognition runs in parallel with existing video analytics without affecting monitoring and alert stability or real-time performance</li>
  <li><strong>Device Detection Region Drawing</strong>: Provides a visual device detection region drawing tool that supports drawing rectangular and polygonal detection regions on device snapshot images, supports flexible association configuration between regions and algorithm models, supports visual management, editing, and deletion of regions, supports keyboard shortcuts to improve drawing efficiency, enabling precise region detection configuration and providing accurate detection range definitions for algorithm tasks</li>
  <li><strong>Intelligent Linked Alert Mechanism</strong>: Supports a triple-link mechanism between detection regions, defense time periods, and event alerts. The system intelligently determines whether a detected event simultaneously meets the specified detection region range, falls within the defense time period, and matches the alert event type. Alerts are only triggered when all three conditions are met, achieving precise spatiotemporal condition filtering, significantly reducing false positive rates, and improving the accuracy and practicality of the alert system</li>
  <li><strong>Large-Scale Camera Management</strong>: Supports access to hundreds of cameras, providing end-to-end services including collection, annotation, training, inference, export, analysis, alerting, recording, storage, and deployment</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithm Task Management</strong>: Supports creation and management of two types of algorithm tasks, each task can flexibly bind frame extractors and sorters to achieve precise video frame extraction and result sorting
    <ul style="margin: 5px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Real-Time Algorithm Tasks</strong>: Used for real-time video analysis, supporting RTSP/RTMP stream real-time processing with millisecond-level response capabilities, suitable for monitoring, security, and other real-time scenarios</li>
      <li><strong>Snapshot Algorithm Tasks</strong>: Used for snapshot image analysis, performing intelligent recognition and analysis on captured images, suitable for event backtracking, image retrieval, and other scenarios</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dataset Annotation and Multi-Format Dataset Management</strong>: Provides a visual image annotation workspace supporting rectangle and polygon labeling, category management, and progress tracking; fully supports flexible import and export of mainstream dataset formats including YOLO, COCO, and ImageFolder, with cloud platform dataset integration enabling one-click import and synchronized export of cloud-hosted datasets—seamlessly connecting data collection, annotation, training, and deployment across the full pipeline</li>
  <li><strong>Stream Forwarding</strong>: Supports direct viewing of camera real-time feeds without enabling AI analysis functionality. By creating stream forwarding tasks, multiple cameras can be batch-pushed, enabling synchronous viewing of multiple video streams to meet pure video monitoring scenario requirements</li>
  <li><strong>GPU Discovery, Load-Aware Allocation, and Multi-GPU Collaboration</strong>: The platform provides GPU resource discovery and intelligent scheduling: it detects the number of available GPUs and dynamically assigns video encode/decode and algorithm inference work across cards according to per-GPU load, running tasks in parallel where appropriate to raise multi-stream throughput and utilization while keeping the pipeline stable—coordinating frame processing and model inference in multi-GPU deployments</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Transport Selection and Resilient Stream Pull</strong>: On RTSP and similar pull paths, the system can evaluate URL/path and related signals to choose and switch transport-layer modes; camera pulls default to UDP for lower latency. When consecutive frames indicate gray screen, decode errors, or stream collapse (decode stall), RTSP reconnect and link recovery run automatically to limit prolonged artifacts or frozen video</li>
  <li><strong>Separate Viewing vs Algorithm Pipelines and Tiered Bitrates</strong>: Live preview and wall viewing are decoupled from algorithm analysis frame extraction in both data path and control policy, with two independent control planes. The viewing path uses about 6500 Kbps to prioritize sharp, smooth monitoring; the algorithm path uses about 3500 Kbps to balance detection quality with compute and bandwidth, avoiding analysis and viewing competing on one high-bitrate channel—so operators get clear, fluid video while analysis stays scalable</li>
  <li><strong>Model Service Cluster Inference</strong>: Supports distributed model inference service clusters, achieving intelligent load balancing, automatic failover, and high availability guarantees, significantly improving inference throughput and system stability</li>

### 💡 Technical Philosophy

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
We believe no single programming language excels at everything, but through the deep integration of three programming languages, yFeiEye leverages the strengths of each to build a powerful technical ecosystem.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
Java excels at building stable and reliable platform architectures but is not suitable for network programming and AI development; Python excels at network programming and AI algorithm development but has bottlenecks in high-performance task execution; C++ excels at high-performance task execution but is less suitable than the other two for platform development and AI programming. yFeiEye adopts a tri-lingual mixed programming architecture, fully leveraging the strengths of each language to build an AIoT platform that's challenging to implement but extremely easy to use.
</p>

### 🤖 Zero-Shot Labeling Technology

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
Innovatively leveraging large models to construct a zero-shot labeling technical system (ideally completely eliminating manual labeling, achieving full automation of the labeling process), this technology generates initial data through large models and completes automatic labeling via prompt engineering. It then ensures data quality through optional human-machine collaborative verification, thereby training an initial small model. This small model, through continuous iteration and self-optimization, achieves co-evolution of labeling efficiency and model accuracy, ultimately driving continuous improvement in system performance.

### 🏗️ Project Architecture Features

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
yFeiEye is not actually one project; it is seven distinct projects.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 15px 0;">
What's the benefit? Suppose you are on a resource-constrained device (like an RK3588). You can extract and independently deploy just one of those projects. Therefore, while this project appears to be a cloud platform, it simultaneously functions as an edge platform.
</p>

<div style="margin: 30px 0; padding: 20px; background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); border-radius: 10px; color: white;">

<p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8; margin: 0; font-weight: 500;">
🌟 Genuine open source is rare. If you find this project useful, please star it before leaving - your support means everything to us!<br>
<small style="font-size: 14px; opacity: 0.9;">(In an era where fake open-source projects are rampant, this project stands out as an exception.)</small>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 10px 0;">
yFeiEye constructs an efficient access and management network for IoT devices (especially massive cameras). We deeply integrate real-time streaming technology with cutting-edge AI to create a unified service core. This solution not only enables interoperability across heterogeneous devices but also deeply integrates HD video streams with powerful AI analytics engines, giving surveillance systems "intelligent eyes" – accurately enabling facial recognition, abnormal behavior analysis, risk personnel monitoring, and perimeter intrusion detection.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8; color: #555; margin: 10px 0;">
The platform supports two types of algorithm tasks: real-time algorithm tasks for real-time video analysis of RTSP/RTMP streams, providing millisecond-level response capabilities; snapshot algorithm tasks for intelligent analysis of captured images, supporting event backtracking and image retrieval. Through algorithm task management, flexible frame extraction and sorting strategies are achieved, with each task able to bind independent frame extractors and sorters. Combined with model service cluster inference capabilities, millisecond-level response and high availability are ensured. Additionally, two defense strategies are provided: full defense mode and half defense mode, allowing flexible configuration of monitoring rules for different time periods, achieving precise time-based intelligent monitoring and alerting.
